# ICS OpenVPN Library

This is a library version of [ICS OpenVPN](https://github.com/schwabe/ics-openvpn) that can be used as an Android library (AAR) in your projects.

## Usage with JitPack

Add the JitPack repository to your root `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        // ... other repositories
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

Add the dependency to your app module's `build.gradle` file:

### OpenVPN 3 variant (recommended):
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.nizwar:ics-openvpn:TAG'
}
```

### OpenVPN 2 variant:
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.nizwar:ics-openvpn-v2:TAG'

Replace `TAG` with the latest release tag or commit hash.
